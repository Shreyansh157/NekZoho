    title: "The Future of Web Development: Trends to Watch in 2025",
    date: "Oct 20, 2024",

    content: `
      <p class="lead mb-4">The web development landscape is constantly evolving. Staying ahead requires understanding the key trends shaping the future.</p>
      <h3 class="fw-bold fs-4 mb-3">1. AI Integration</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Artificial intelligence is becoming integral, from AI-powered chatbots and personalized user experiences to AI-assisted coding and automated testing.</p>
      <h3 class="fw-bold fs-4 mb-3">2. Serverless Architecture</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Moving away from traditional server management, serverless allows developers to focus purely on code while cloud providers handle infrastructure scaling and maintenance.</p>
      <h3 class="fw-bold fs-4 mb-3">3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">PWAs continue to bridge the gap between web and native applications, offering offline capabilities, push notifications, and installability directly from the browser.</p>
      <h3 class="fw-bold fs-4 mb-3">4. WebAssembly (Wasm)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Wasm enables running high-performance code (like C++, Rust) in the browser, opening doors for complex applications, games, and computationally intensive tasks on the web.</p>
      <h3 class="fw-bold fs-4 mb-3">5. Cybersecurity Focus</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">With increasing threats, security is paramount. Expect more emphasis on secure coding practices, automated vulnerability scanning, and robust authentication methods.</p>
      <p>Adapting to these trends will be crucial for building modern, efficient, and secure web applications in 2025 and beyond.</p>
